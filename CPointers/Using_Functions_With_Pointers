To use pointers for passing value of a variable to a function from main or any aprt of a program we do :

func_name(&variable_name);

and we define a function as : func_name(int *pointer_name){
 /*here we can alter or change value of pointed variable by performing any operation as result the value of varaible will be changed for both parts of a program i.e. in main and in the function being call'd */

*pointer_name = *pointer_name + 2 ; /* similarly we can perform any other arithmeti or logical operation and change the pointed variable value */

} 
        
This above method of passing variables to a function by using it's address instead of it's own value is called " Pass by reference " same holds true when we we pass address of a structure,array to another function,thread instead of original value by using pointers is called 
" Pass by reference"
