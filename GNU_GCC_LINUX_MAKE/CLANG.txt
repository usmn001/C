-----------Clang compiler---------------
clang is also a compiler apart from gnu g++ compiler it providing more diagnostics and also consuming less memory.

To use clang compiler in terminal we similary execute following command in terminal : 
clang++ source_code_filename.cpp 

To use a specific standard or version of C++ we use -std flag and also with g++ compiler at the time of code
compilation as :
clang++ -std=c++11 code_file.cpp 
g++ -std=c++11 code_file.cpp

Just like we enable errors and diagnostics by using gcc compiler with Wall when compiling c code here in 
case of c++ code we also do same i.e.
clang++ -std=c++11 -Wall source_code.cpp
g++ -std=c11 -Wall source_code.cpp

And similarly for enabling the compilers clang++ and g++ to show more warning we use one extra flag that is 
-Wextra at the time of compilation i.e.
clang++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -o executable_name source_code.cpp
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -o executable_name source_code.cpp
