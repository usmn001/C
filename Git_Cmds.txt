************************Git : Setting Up Credentials Commands*********************

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
git config --global user.password "yourpassword"



************************************Git : Repo Commands********************************
git init
git clone (url)
git add (file names)                          " For adding file names for committing "
git rm file_name                              " For removing files from the repo "
git commit -m "(committed message)
git push -u origin master

**************************Git : Branch commands********************************

We can use git branch and git switch commands for creating a new branch for pushing to remote as illustrated below : 

git switch -c new_branch_name                " Command for creating new branch for pushing to remote "
git checkout -b new_branch_name              " Command for creating new branch for pushing to remote "
git branch new_branch_name                   " Command for creating new branch for pushing to remote "
git branch                                   " Command for checking which branch currently is used "  
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name   " Command For pushing to a new branch for first time when it's created "
git checkout branch_name                     " Command for switching to another branch or main, for main it will be git checkout main "
git branch -d lte_modem                      " Command for deleting a branch "  
git push origin :branch_name                 " Command for updating remote about branch deletion"
git pull repo_link.git or git pull           " Command for updating or syncing local repo from remote repo "
     
git remote add origin master (url)           " Command for adding new remote repo to current repo "
git remote -v                                " Command for verifying new remote "
    


**************Setting Up Git SSH Keys********************

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your email address" /* Command for generating ssh key */

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"        /* Command for starting SSH agent */

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519     /* Command for adding ssh key where ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 is the path where ssh key is stored in id_ed25519.
                               This path could be changed at the time of key creation*/
                               
                               
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub   /* Command for viewing,copying the ssh key stored at ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub to git account 
                                */                                  

ssh -T git@github.com         /* Command for testing your Github ssh connection */   

     

ssh -vT git@github.com        /* Command for checking which ssh key is accepted or refused */

Your identification has been saved in /home/musman/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/musman/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
